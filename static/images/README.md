# Images Directory

Place your restaurant images in this folder to use in the website.

## Required Images for Home Page:

1. **hero-burger.jpg** - Main hero section burger image (recommended: 800x600px)
2. **chef-special.jpg** - Circular feature section outer image (recommended: 600x600px)
3. **signature-dish.jpg** - Circular feature section inner image (recommended: 400x400px)

## Image Guidelines:

- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size:** Keep images under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Dimensions:** High-resolution images work best (at least 1920px width for hero images)
- **Content:** High-quality food photography with good lighting

## Fallback Images:

The website currently uses Unsplash fallback images if local images are not found. Replace these with your own professional food photography for the best results.

## Menu Item Images:

Menu item images should be uploaded through the Django admin panel at:
`/admin/main/menuitem/`

Each menu item can have its own image which will be displayed in the menu grid.
